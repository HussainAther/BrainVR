# BrainVR
This app is a virtual study of the brain for STEMXR Outreach we hope to use in educating the youth about the brain, neuroscience, mental health, and general science in the hopes of raising awareness of the power and potential of VR 

### Key Strengths for the App 
1. Inclusion and mental illness awareness component: social aspect 
2. Neuroscience: very attractive STEM field : STEM educational aspect
3. Gamification : for entertainment
4. Depending on the design, we can push for providing a science credit for the students from the school board
5. Extracurricular activity that can be a merit for university application
